# Graduate Admissions Predictor

## Overview

This project serves as a tool to predict the chance of admission into graduate programs based on various factors commonly considered during the application process.

## Admission Factors

- **GRE Scores (out of 340):** The Graduate Record Examination (GRE) is a standardized test used for admission into graduate programs. Scores range from 260 to 340, combining verbal and quantitative reasoning.

- **TOEFL Scores (out of 120):** The Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) measures English language proficiency for non-native English speakers. Scores range from 0 to 120.

- **University Rating (out of 5):** This refers to the reputation or ranking of the university where the applicant completed or intends to complete their undergraduate studies.

- **Statement of Purpose (SOP) Strength (out of 5):** The SOP is a written essay where applicants describe their academic and professional goals, research interests, and reasons for applying to a particular program. Strength is subjectively evaluated.

- **Letter of Recommendation (LOR) Strength (out of 5):** LORs are written by professors or professionals who can attest to the applicant's abilities and potential. Strength indicates the quality and impact of these recommendations.

- **Undergraduate GPA-CGPA (out of 10):** The Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) reflects the overall academic performance of the applicant during their undergraduate studies. It is typically measured on a scale of 0 to 10.

- **Research Experience (0 or 1):** Indicates whether the applicant has any research experience (1) or not (0).

- **Chance of Admit (ranging from 0 to 1):** A calculated probability indicating the likelihood of an applicant being admitted to the graduate program. It is based on various factors, including the ones mentioned above.
