# Graduate Admissions Prediction System

## Overview

The Admission Prediction System project aims to build a predictive model that assists students in estimating their likelihood of admission to a particular educational institution based on various features. Leveraging machine learning techniques, this project provides valuable insights into the factors influencing admission decisions and helps prospective students make informed choices.

This project serves as a tool to predict the chance of admission into graduate programs based on various factors commonly considered during the application process.

## Admission Factors

- **GRE Scores (out of 340):** The Graduate Record Examination (GRE) is a standardized test used for admission into graduate programs. Scores range from 260 to 340, combining verbal and quantitative reasoning.

- **TOEFL Scores (out of 120):** The Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) measures English language proficiency for non-native English speakers. Scores range from 0 to 120.

- **University Rating (out of 5):** This refers to the reputation or ranking of the university where the applicant completed or intends to complete their undergraduate studies.

- **Statement of Purpose (SOP) Strength (out of 5):** The SOP is a written essay where applicants describe their academic and professional goals, research interests, and reasons for applying to a particular program. Strength is subjectively evaluated.

- **Letter of Recommendation (LOR) Strength (out of 5):** LORs are written by professors or professionals who can attest to the applicant's abilities and potential. Strength indicates the quality and impact of these recommendations.

- **Undergraduate GPA-CGPA (out of 10):** The Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) reflects the overall academic performance of the applicant during their undergraduate studies. It is typically measured on a scale of 0 to 10.

- **Research Experience (0 or 1):** Indicates whether the applicant has any research experience (1) or not (0).

- **Chance of Admit (ranging from 0 to 1):** A calculated probability indicating the likelihood of an applicant being admitted to the graduate program. It is based on various factors, including the ones mentioned above.


Data Collection:

Gather a dataset containing historical admission records, including features such as GRE scores, TOEFL scores, undergraduate GPA, and letters of recommendation.
Ensure the dataset is diverse and representative of the target educational institutions.
Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing data and outliers.
Normalize numerical features and encode categorical variables.
Explore and visualize relationships between different features and admission outcomes.
Feature Selection:

Identify key features that significantly contribute to admission decisions.
Use techniques like correlation analysis and feature importance ranking.
Model Development:

Select an appropriate machine learning algorithm for binary classification, such as logistic regression, support vector machines, or decision trees.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train the model on the training set and fine-tune hyperparameters.
Model Evaluation:

Assess the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.
Implement cross-validation to ensure robustness.
User Interface (UI):

Develop a user-friendly interface for students to input their details and receive predictions.
Integrate the trained model into the UI for seamless user interaction.
Deployment:

Deploy the Admission Prediction System, either as a web application or a standalone tool.
Implement security measures to protect user data.
Dependencies:
Python (>=3.6)
Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, Flask (for web applications), etc.
Usage:
Clone the repository.
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Follow the instructions in the provided notebooks (or scripts) to preprocess data, train the model, and set up the user interface.
